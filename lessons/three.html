      <h2>Post</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p class="point">If you are using WordPress as a blog, then you will end up using posts for majority of your site’s content. Posts are content entries listed in reverse chronological order on your blog’s home page. Due to their reverse chronological order, your posts are meant to be timely. Older posts are archived based on month and year. As the post gets older, the deeper the user has to dig to find it. You have the option to organize your posts based on categories and tags.</p>
      <p class="point">Because WordPress posts are published with time and date in mind, they are syndicated through the RSS feeds. This allows your readers to be notified of the most recent post update via RSS feeds. Bloggers can use the RSS feeds to deliver email broadcasts through services like Aweber or MailChimp. You can create a daily and weekly newsletter for your audience to subscribe to. The very timely nature of posts make it extremely social. You can use one of the many social sharing plugins to allow your users to share your posts in social media networks like Twitter, Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn etc.</p>
      <p class="point">Posts encourage conversation. They have a built-in commenting feature that allows users to comment on a particular topic. You can go to your Settings » Discussion to turn off comments on older posts if you like.</p>
      <p class="point"><a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts" target="blank">https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts</a></p>
      <div class="point">
        <p class="excercise">Create a new post with the title: 5 Things I Like About Technology. Then list those 5 things in the post and publish the post.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div><!-- end Post -->

  <div class="row"><!-- Pages -->
    <h2 class="col-md-3">Pages</h2>
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p class="point">Pages are meant to be static “one-off” type content such as your about page, privacy policy, legal disclaimers, etc. While the WordPress database stores the published date of the page, pages are timeless entities. For example, your about page is not suppose to expire. Sure you can go back and make updates to it, but chances are you will not have about page 2012, about page 2013 etc. Because there is no time and date tied to pages, they are not included in your RSS feeds by default. Pages are not meant to be social in most cases thus does not include social sharing buttons, or comments.</p>
      <p class="point">You don’t want users to comment on your contact page, or your legal disclaimers page. Just like you probably don’t want others to tweet your privacy policy page in most cases.
      Unlike posts, pages are hierarchical by nature. For example, you can have a sub pages within a page. A key example of this in action would be our Blueprint page. This feature allows you to organize your pages together, and even assign a custom template to them.</p>
      <p class="point">WordPress by default comes with a feature that allows you create custom page templates using your theme. This allows developers to customize the look of each page when necessary. In most themes, post and pages look the same. But when you are using your page to create a landing page, or a gallery page, then this custom page templates feature comes in very handy.</p>
      <p class="point">Pages also have this archaic feature called Order which lets you customize the order of pages by assigning a number value to it. However this feature is extended by plugins like Simple Page Ordering that allows you to drag &amp; drop the order of pages.</p>
      <p class="point"><a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Pages" target="blank">https://codex.wordpress.org/Pages</a></p>
      <div class="point">
        <p class="excercise"> Create a new page with the title: About Me. Then write a small paragraph about yourself and publish the page.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div><!-- end Pages -->

  <div class="row"><!-- Categories -->
    <div class="col-md-3">
      <h2>Categories</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p class="point">Category is one of the pre-defined taxonomies in WordPress. It is used to sort and group content into different sections. A website publishing content on a variety of topics can divide their website into sections using categories.</p>
      <p class="point">Example: A news website can have categories for articles filed under News, Opinion, Weather, Sports, etc.</p>
      <p class="point">If no category is specified for a post then the post is automatically filed into the default category. In a new WordPress installation, the default category is ‘Uncategorized’. A website administrator can change default category from Settings » Writing screen. A WordPress post can be filed under multiple categories and can have both categories and tags.</p>
      <p class="point"><a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts_Categories_SubPanel" target="blank">https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts_Categories_SubPanel</a></p>
      <div class="point">
        <p class="excercise"> Create a new category with the title: geekwise. Make sure the slug makes sense, and  add a description. Then create another category with the parent of 'geekwise'.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div><!-- end Categories -->

  <div class="row"><!-- Tags -->
    <div class="col-md-3">
      <h2>Tags</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p class="point">Tags are meant to describe specific details of your posts. Think of these as your site’s index words. They are the micro-data that you can use to micro-categorize your content. Tags are not hierarchical.</p>
      <p class="point">For example if you have a personal blog where you write about your life. Your categories can be something like: Music, Food, Travel, Rambling, and Books. Now when you write a post about something that you ate, you will add it in the Food category. You can add tags like pizza, pasta, steak etc.</p>
      <p class="point">One of the biggest difference between tags and categories is that you MUST categorize your post. You are not required to add any tags. If you do not categorize your post, then it will be categorized under the “uncategorized” category. People often rename the uncategorized category to something like Other, ramblings etc.</p>
      <p class="point">Another difference is the way your category and tags permalinks (urls) look. If you are using a custom permalink (URL) structure, then your base prefix will look different. Example:</p>
      <p class="point"><code>http://yoursite.com/category/food/</code></p>
      <p class="point">vs.</p>
      <p class="point"><code>http://yoursite.com/tag/food/</code></p>
      <div class="point">
        <p class="excercise"> Create a new tag with the title: php. Make sure the slug makes sense, and  add a description.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div><!-- end Tags -->

  <div class="row"><!-- Comments -->
    <h2 class="col-md-3">Comments</h2>
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p class="point">Comments provide your website’s visitors a platform to communicate with you and other readers. It allows them to add their input on the topic, ask questions, and provide feedback. They allows for community interaction around your content.</p>
      <p class="point">WordPress comes with a comment management system of its own. WordPress posts, pages, and other post types can accept comments. All WordPress themes come equipped with comment layout templates. However, it is up to you to engage users on your website and encourage them to leave comments.</p>
    </div>
  </div><!-- end Comments -->

  <div class="row"><!-- Settings -->
    <h2 class="col-md-3">Settings</h2>
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p class="point">This Settings <strong>General</strong> Screen is the default Screen in the Settings Administration Screen and controls some of the most basic configuration settings for your site: your site's title and location, who may register an account at your site, and how dates and times are calculated and displayed.</p>
      <p class="point"><a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_General_Screen" target="blank">https://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_General_Screen</a></p>
      <p class="point">Use the Settings <strong>Writing</strong> Screen to control the interface you use when writing new posts. These settings control WordPress's features in the adding and editing posts, Pages, and Post Types, as well as the optional functions like Remote Publishing, Post via e-mail, and Update Services.</p>
      <p class="point"><a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_Writing_Screen" target="blank">https://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_Writing_Screen</a></p>
      <p class="point">The options in the Settings <strong>Reading</strong> Screen are few in number, but still important. You can decide if you want posts or a "static" Page displayed as your blog's front (main) page. You can also adjust how many posts are displayed on that main page. In addition, you can adjust syndication feed features to determine how the information from your site is sent to a reader's web browser or other applications.</p>

      <p class="point">The Settings <strong>Discussion</strong> Screen allows you to set the options concerning comments (also called discussion). It is here the administrator decides if comments are allowed, if pingbacks and trackbacks are acceptable, and what constitutes Comment Spam. On this Screen you also control the circumstances under which your blog sends you e-mail notification of certain events at your site.</p>

      <p class="point">The Settings <strong>Media</strong> Screen controls the various settings related to images and other media that are used in writing posts and pages.</p>

      <p class="point"><strong>Permalinks</strong> are the permanent URLs to your individual pages and blog posts, as well as your category and tag archives. A permalink is the web address used to link to your content. The URL to each post should be permanent, and never change — hence the name permalink. The Settings Permalinks Screen allows you to choose your default permalink structure. You can choose from common settings or create custom URL structures. You must click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the screen for new settings to take effect.</p>
